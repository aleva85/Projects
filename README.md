# Portfolio of projects
Welcome to my GitHub space! This is a small sample of some of my projects revolving around human perception, sensory information processing, and data analysis.
It is also a fun place for me where to practice and improve my analytical and programming skills, and have fun while doing so.

Every folder contains a short project on which I have worked in my free time. Feel free to take a peak at the nootbooks, and drop me a line if you wish to get in contact.
